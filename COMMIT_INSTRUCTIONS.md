# Git Commit Instructions

**IMPORTANT:** For every change made to the codebase (file creation, modification, or deletion), you must immediately perform the following Git operations:

1.  **Stage Changes:** `git add .`
2.  **Commit Changes:** `git commit -m "Description of changes made"`
3.  **Push to Remote:** `git push origin main`

This ensures a granular history is maintained, allowing for easy rollback if a new change introduces bugs.
